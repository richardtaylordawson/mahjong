# Mahjong
> Mahjong tiles (no game logic) built using OOP in Java.

## Things I Learned
This was a project completed during my time at Weber State University. This was a great project to learn how to create a full application in Java and how object oriented programming flows together to create very clean and sound logic that is easy to maintain down the road.

## Run Project
```shell
$ java Gameboard.java 
```
