# Mahjong
> Mahjong tiles (no game logic) built using OOP in Java. Run the Gameboard.java file to see all the tiles laid out just like below.

## Things I Learned
This was a project completed during my time at Weber State University. This was a great project to learn how to create a full application in Java and how object oriented programming flows together to create very clean and sound logic that is easy to maintain down the road.

## Run Project
